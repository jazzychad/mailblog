## jazzychad's base mailblog template

You will want to replace all references to 'example.com' throughout
this repo to match your own name/url. You can grep for all mentions
with this command:

`grep -rHn "example\.com" .`

Then play with the layouts and sass files to your heart's content!

You will probably also want to delete the 'First Post', but I left it
in here so you can get a feel for the layout of the home/archive/post
pages...

Last but not least, update or remove the favicon.ico and
apple-touch-icon.png files.
